# Frontend Chat Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem Summary
The frontend chat was failing with "Message is required" error because it was trying to connect directly to the backend instead of using the proxy.

## Root Cause
The `netlify.toml` file was hardcoding `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in the build configuration:
```toml
[context.production.environment]
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = "https://throp-bot-947985992378.us-central1.run.app/api/chat"
```

This environment variable was being baked into the frontend JavaScript at build time, causing the frontend to bypass the proxy and attempt direct backend connections, which failed due to CORS.

## The Fix
1. Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from all contexts in `netlify.toml`
2. This allows the frontend logic to correctly detect no API URL and use the proxy
3. The proxy (`/api/proxy`) handles all backend communication without CORS issues

## Technical Details
- **Before**: Frontend tried to connect to `https://throp-bot-947985992378.us-central1.run.app/api/chat` directly
- **After**: Frontend connects to `/api/proxy` which forwards requests to the backend
- **Result**: No more CORS errors, chat works perfectly

## Verification
The fix has been deployed and tested:
- New JavaScript chunk: `page-1cdff574318be909.js` (replaced old `page-f216685c730a58c7.js`)
- Proxy endpoint tested and working
- Chat functionality restored

## Lessons Learned
1. Environment variables in `netlify.toml` override everything else
2. `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are compiled at build time, not runtime
3. Always check the build configuration files, not just the code
4. Deep investigation requires checking the entire deployment pipeline
