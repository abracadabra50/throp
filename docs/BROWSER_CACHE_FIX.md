# Browser Cache Issue - Resolution Guide

## Problem Identified
Your browser is using an old cached version of the JavaScript file (`page-f216685c730a58c7.js`) that has a bug in the message extraction logic.

## The Fix is Already Deployed
- ✅ Backend is working perfectly
- ✅ Proxy endpoint is functioning correctly
- ✅ New code has been deployed to production
- ❌ Your browser hasn't updated to the new version

## How to Fix (Do This Now)

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
- **Mac/Chrome**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Windows/Chrome**: `Ctrl + Shift + F5`
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Option + R`
- **Firefox**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`

### Option 2: Clear Site Data
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Find **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Clear site data** button

### Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode
- Chrome: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N`
- Safari: `Cmd + Shift + N`
- Firefox: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`

## Technical Details
The issue was that the frontend JavaScript was using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` which gets compiled at build time. When we removed this environment variable, the old cached build still had it compiled in, causing the frontend to bypass the proxy and try to connect directly to a non-existent endpoint.

## Verification
After clearing cache, you should:
1. No longer see errors about "Message is required"
2. Be able to chat normally on https://throp.ai
3. See the chat responses appearing correctly

## Prevention
For future deployments, we've:
- Removed local `.env.local` files that could interfere
- Ensured consistent environment variable management
- Added cache-busting headers to critical endpoints
