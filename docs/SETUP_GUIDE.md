# üöÄ Throp Setup Guide for Non-Developers

This guide will walk you through setting up your Throp Twitter bot step by step, even if you've never coded before!

## üìã What You'll Need

Before we start, make sure you have:
1. A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
2. A Twitter/X account for your bot
3. A credit card for API services (small charges apply)
4. About 30-60 minutes

## Step 1: Install Required Software

### 1.1 Install Node.js
Node.js is what runs our bot. Think of it as the engine!

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Click the big green button that says "LTS" (Long Term Support)
3. Download and run the installer
4. Follow the installation wizard (just click "Next" for all options)

**To check it worked:**
- On Windows: Open Command Prompt (search for "cmd")
- On Mac: Open Terminal (search for "Terminal")
- Type `node --version` and press Enter
- You should see something like `v20.11.0`

### 1.2 Install Git (Optional but Recommended)
Git helps us download and update the bot code.

1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Download for your system
3. Run the installer (default options are fine)

## Step 2: Get the Bot Code

### Option A: Using Git (Recommended)
1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Navigate to where you want the bot:
   - Type `cd Desktop` to put it on your desktop
3. Type this command and press Enter:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/throp.git
   ```
4. Enter the bot folder:
   ```
   cd throp
   ```

### Option B: Download Manually
1. Download the code as a ZIP file
2. Extract it to your Desktop
3. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
4. Type `cd Desktop/throp` and press Enter

## Step 3: Install Bot Dependencies

In your Terminal/Command Prompt (make sure you're in the throp folder):
1. Type this command and press Enter:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Wait for it to finish (might take 2-5 minutes)

## Step 4: Set Up Twitter Developer Account

### 4.1 Create Developer Account
1. Go to [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Choose "Hobbyist" ‚Üí "Making a bot"
4. Fill in the application (be honest about making a bot!)
5. Wait for approval (usually instant, sometimes takes a day)

### 4.2 Create Your App
1. Once approved, go to the [Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
2. Click "Create Project"
   - Name: "Throp Bot" (or whatever you like)
   - Use case: "Making a bot"
3. Click "Create App" under your project
   - App name: Must be unique (try "ThropBot_YourName")

### 4.3 Get Your Keys
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Save these somewhere safe! You'll only see them once!

5. Type of App: "Web App"
6. Callback URL: `https://your-app.com/callback` (placeholder)
7. Website URL: Your Twitter profile URL
8. Save

### 4.5 Choose API Plan
1. Go to "Products" ‚Üí "Twitter API v2"
2. Choose a plan:
   - **Free**: NOT supported (too limited)
   - **Basic** ($100/month): Good for starting
   - **Pro** ($5000/month): For serious bots
3. Enter payment details

## Step 5: Get OpenAI API Key

This gives your bot its "brain"!

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click your profile (top right) ‚Üí "View API keys"
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Name it "Throp Bot"
6. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)
7. Add payment method:
   - Click "Billing" ‚Üí "Payment methods"
   - Add your card
   - Set a monthly budget (start with $10-20)

## Step 6: Configure Your Bot

### 6.1 Create Configuration File
1. In the throp folder, find the file called `env.example`
2. Make a copy and rename it to `.env` (yes, with the dot!)
   - On Windows: Might need to enable "show file extensions"
   - On Mac: Press Cmd+Shift+. to show hidden files

### 6.2 Edit Configuration
Open `.env` in a text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac)

Replace the values with your actual keys:

```env
# Twitter Settings (from Step 4)
TWITTER_API_KEY=paste_your_api_key_here
TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY=paste_your_api_secret_here
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=paste_your_access_token_here
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=paste_your_access_secret_here
TWITTER_BOT_USERNAME=your_bot_username
TWITTER_BOT_USER_ID=your_bot_user_id
TWITTER_API_PLAN=basic

# OpenAI Settings (from Step 5)
OPENAI_API_KEY=paste_your_openai_key_here

# Bot Settings (you can change these!)
MAX_MENTIONS_PER_BATCH=5
MAX_TWEETS_PER_HOUR=20
DRY_RUN=true  # Start with true to test!
```

### 6.3 Find Your Twitter User ID
1. Go to [tweeterid.com](https://tweeterid.com/)
2. Enter your bot's username
3. Copy the number
4. Paste it as `TWITTER_BOT_USER_ID` in your `.env` file

## Step 7: Test Your Bot

Time to see if everything works!

### 7.1 Dry Run Test
1. In Terminal/Command Prompt (in the throp folder)
2. Type and press Enter:
   ```
   npm run dev -- --dry-run
   ```
3. The bot will start but won't actually tweet
4. If you see "Configuration loaded successfully" - it works! üéâ

### 7.2 Process a Specific Tweet (Safe Test)
1. Find a tweet mentioning your bot
2. Copy its ID (the numbers at the end of the URL)
3. Run:
   ```
   npm run dev -- --dry-run -t "paste_tweet_id_here"
   ```

### 7.3 Go Live!
When you're ready to actually start responding:
1. Change `DRY_RUN=false` in your `.env` file
2. Run:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Step 8: Keep It Running

### Option A: Manual Running
Run the bot whenever you want:
```
npm run dev
```

### Option B: Continuous Mode
Let it run forever, checking every 5 minutes:
```
npm run dev -- --continuous --interval 5
```

### Option C: Cloud Hosting (Advanced)
For 24/7 operation, consider services like:
- Heroku (easy, free tier available)
- DigitalOcean ($5/month)
- AWS (complex but powerful)

## üéõÔ∏è Customising Your Bot

### Change How It Responds
Edit these in your `.env` file:

```env
# How many tweets to process at once (1-10)
MAX_MENTIONS_PER_BATCH=5

# How many tweets per hour (stay under limits!)
MAX_TWEETS_PER_HOUR=20

# Temperature (0.1 = boring, 1.0 = creative)
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7

# Model (gpt-3.5-turbo is cheaper, gpt-4 is smarter)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
```

### Monitor Costs
- OpenAI: Check [platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- Twitter: Check your developer portal

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" Error
- Make sure you're in the right folder (`cd Desktop/throp`)
- Make sure Node.js is installed (`node --version`)

### "API key invalid" Error
- Double-check you copied the keys correctly
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Regenerate keys if needed

### Bot Not Responding to Mentions
- Check the bot username is correct
- Make sure `DRY_RUN=false`
- Check Twitter API plan is active
- Wait 5-10 minutes (Twitter can be slow)

### Rate Limit Errors
- Reduce `MAX_MENTIONS_PER_BATCH`
- Reduce `MAX_TWEETS_PER_HOUR`
- Upgrade Twitter API plan if needed

## üí∞ Expected Costs

Monthly estimates for moderate use:
- Twitter API Basic: $100
- OpenAI: $10-50 (depends on usage)
- Hosting (optional): $5-20
- **Total: ~$115-170/month**

## üÜò Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: The bot tells you what's wrong!
2. **Read error messages**: They usually explain the problem
3. **Search the error**: Copy error messages into Google
4. **Ask for help**: Create an issue on GitHub
5. **Twitter/X Developer Forum**: [twittercommunity.com](https://twittercommunity.com/)

## üéØ Next Steps

Once your bot is running:
1. Monitor its responses
2. Adjust temperature and settings
3. Add more features (see README.md)
4. Consider Redis for better performance
5. Set up monitoring alerts
