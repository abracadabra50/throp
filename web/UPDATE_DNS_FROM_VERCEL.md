# ðŸ”„ UPDATE: Your DNS Needs to be Changed from Vercel to Netlify

## Current Situation
Your domain `chat.throp.ai` is currently pointing to **Vercel** (not Netlify):
```
Current: chat.throp.ai â†’ c3e21c5d635f7780.vercel-dns-017.com (Vercel)
Needed:  chat.throp.ai â†’ throp.netlify.app (Netlify)
```

## Quick Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Update DNS Record

Go to your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.) and:

1. **Find** the existing CNAME record for `chat`
2. **Change** the value from: `c3e21c5d635f7780.vercel-dns-017.com`
3. **To**: `throp.netlify.app`

### If Using Cloudflare:
1. Login â†’ Select `throp.ai`
2. Go to **DNS** â†’ **Records**
3. Find the CNAME record for `chat`
4. Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
5. Change Target to: `throp.netlify.app`
6. Make sure Proxy status is **DNS only** (grey cloud)
7. Save

### If Using Namecheap:
1. Domain List â†’ Manage â†’ Advanced DNS
2. Find CNAME record with Host `chat`
3. Click edit
4. Change Value to: `throp.netlify.app`
5. Save

### If Using GoDaddy:
1. My Products â†’ DNS
2. Find CNAME for `chat`
3. Edit â†’ Change Points to: `throp.netlify.app`
4. Save

### Step 2: Add Domain in Netlify

While DNS is updating:
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/throp/domain-management
2. Click **"Add a domain"**
3. Enter: `chat.throp.ai`
4. Click **"Add domain"**

### Step 3: Wait for Propagation

DNS changes can take 5-30 minutes to propagate.

## Verification

Check if the change has propagated:

```bash
# Should show: throp.netlify.app
nslookup chat.throp.ai

# Or use dig
dig chat.throp.ai CNAME +short
```

Once it shows `throp.netlify.app`, your site will be accessible at https://chat.throp.ai

## Why This Happened

You previously had this domain configured for Vercel deployment. Now that we've moved to Netlify, the DNS needs to be updated to point to the new location.

## Current Access

- **Working Now**: https://throp.netlify.app âœ…
- **After DNS Update**: https://chat.throp.ai âœ…

---

**Action Required**: Just update that one CNAME record from Vercel to Netlify! ðŸš€
