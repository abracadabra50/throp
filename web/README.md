- looks like it was drawn by a 5 year old
- speaks in lowercase (mostly)
- rates everything in oranges (1-10 üçä)
- occasionally forgets how to function
- Comic Sans EVERYWHERE
- intentionally misaligned everything

## Features

- üçä **Orange-themed UI**: Beautiful gradient design with orange as the primary colour
- üí¨ **Real-time chat**: Powered by Vercel AI SDK and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- üé≠ **Unique personality**: Witty, self-aware responses with intentional typos and meme references
- ‚ö° **Fast responses**: Edge runtime for optimal performance
- üé® **Animated interface**: Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion
- üì± **Responsive design**: Works beautifully on all devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Backend API running on port 3001 (or configure NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL)
- An Anthropic API key if running the API locally ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Installation

1. Navigate to the web directory:
```bash
cd web
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

4. Edit `.env.local` and configure:
```
# Point to your backend API (default: http://localhost:3001/api/chat)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/chat

# Only needed if running API locally
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Troubleshooting API Connection

If you're getting errors when trying to chat:

### 1. Check if your backend API is running
Make sure your API server is running on port 3001. The frontend expects the API at:
```
http://localhost:3001/api/chat
```

### 2. Test the connection
Open `test-api.html` in your browser to test if the API is accessible:
```bash
open test-api.html
```

### 3. Using the proxy (automatic)
The frontend automatically uses a proxy route (`/api/proxy`) to avoid CORS issues when connecting to localhost:3001.

### 4. Custom API endpoint
If your API is running on a different port or URL, update `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-api-url/api/chat
```

### 5. Check browser console
Open browser dev tools (F12) and check the Console tab for detailed error messages.

## How to Customise throp's Personality

```

To add new catchphrases:
```typescript
// Add to the system prompt
"You occasionally say 'orange you curious?' instead of 'aren't you curious?'"
```

To change the response style:
```typescript
// Modify the model
model: anthropic('claude-3-5-haiku-20241022'), // Use Haiku for faster, shorter responses
```
