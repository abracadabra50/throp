# Domain Routing Solution - FIXED ✅

## The Problem
When visiting `chat.throp.ai` and clicking "go back", you were still on `chat.throp.ai` (not `throp.ai`), so the chat interface would keep showing instead of the landing page.

## The Solution
We've implemented proper domain-aware routing that detects which domain you're on and behaves accordingly:

### How It Works

1. **`chat.throp.ai`** (Chat Subdomain)
   - Always shows the chat interface directly
   - No "go back" button (you're already on the chat domain)
   - Accepts URL parameters for prompts (e.g., `?prompt=hello`)

2. **`throp.ai`** (Main Domain)
   - Shows the landing page
   - All buttons redirect to `chat.throp.ai` (not internal navigation)
   - Passes prompts via URL parameters

3. **Local Development** (`localhost`, `*.netlify.app`)
   - Allows switching between landing and chat views
   - Shows "go back" button in chat
   - Uses state-based navigation (no redirects)

### Key Features

✅ **Smart Domain Detection**
- Automatically detects if you're on chat subdomain, main domain, or local
- Shows appropriate content based on domain

✅ **Seamless Prompt Passing**
- Landing page buttons pass prompts to chat via URL parameters
- Example: Clicking a prompt on `throp.ai` → redirects to `chat.throp.ai?prompt=your+question`
- Chat automatically loads the prompt and clears the URL

✅ **Developer-Friendly**
- Local development maintains the ability to switch between views
- No need for multiple deployments or complex routing

### Implementation Details

**Files Changed:**
- `/web/src/utils/domain-detect.ts` - Domain detection utilities
- `/web/src/app/page.tsx` - Updated navigation logic
- `/web/next.config.ts` - Fixed SVG rendering (unoptimized: true)

**Functions:**
- `getDomainType()` - Returns 'chat', 'landing', or 'local'
- `shouldAutoShowChat()` - Returns true for chat.throp.ai
- `canNavigateBetweenPages()` - Returns true only for local environments
- `getChatUrl()` / `getLandingUrl()` - Returns appropriate URLs for navigation

### Testing

1. **On chat.throp.ai:**
   - ✅ Should show chat directly
   - ✅ No "go back" button
   - ✅ Can receive prompts via URL parameters

2. **On throp.ai:**
   - ✅ Should show landing page
   - ✅ Buttons redirect to chat.throp.ai
   - ✅ Prompts passed via URL parameters

3. **On localhost:**
   - ✅ Can switch between landing and chat
   - ✅ "go back" button visible in chat
   - ✅ State-based navigation works

### DNS Configuration Required

For this to work fully, ensure:
```
chat.throp.ai → CNAME → throp.netlify.app
throp.ai → (separate deployment or redirect)
```

### Build Status
The fix is now deployed. Once Netlify builds complete (~2-3 minutes), the domain routing will work as expected.

## Summary
This solution provides a clean separation between your landing page (throp.ai) and chat interface (chat.throp.ai) while maintaining a smooth user experience and developer-friendly local environment.
