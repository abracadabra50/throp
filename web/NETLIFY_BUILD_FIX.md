# ✅ Netlify Build Fix - Dependency Conflict Resolved

## Problem
The build was failing with this error:
```
npm error While resolving: @ai-sdk/ui-utils@1.2.11
npm error Found: zod@4.0.17
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer zod@"^3.23.8" from @ai-sdk/ui-utils@1.2.11
```

## Root Cause
- `@ai-sdk/ui-utils@1.2.11` required `zod@^3.23.8`
- But our project was using `zod@^4.0.17`
- This created a peer dependency conflict

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Unused Dependency ✅
- Removed `@ai-sdk/ui-utils` from `package.json` (it wasn't being used in the code)

### 2. Updated Build Configuration ✅
- Moved `netlify.toml` to repository root
- Updated build paths to work from root:
  - Build command: `cd web && npm install && npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `web/.next`
  - Base directory: `/`

### 3. Cleaned Lock Files ✅
- Removed conflicting `package-lock.json` files

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`web/package.json`** - Removed `@ai-sdk/ui-utils` dependency
2. **`netlify.toml`** - Moved to root and updated paths
3. **Removed** - `package-lock.json` files

### Git Commit:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix Netlify build: Remove conflicting zod dependency and update build config"
```

## Build Status

The build should now work! Netlify will:
1. Auto-detect the push to GitHub
2. Start a new build
3. Deploy successfully

## Verify Success

Check the build status at:
- https://app.netlify.com/sites/throp/deploys

The build should show ✅ instead of ❌

## Next Steps

Once the build succeeds:
1. Your site will be live at: https://throp.netlify.app
2. After DNS update: https://chat.throp.ai
